# Concert Seating â€” Challenge

This is a simple application that allows users to reserve seats for a concert. The application is built with Laravel and Nuxt 3.

## Get Started

To get started, you'll need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Composer 2
- PHP 8
- nvm or Node 16 _(v18 works as well)_

I have also included some VSCode settings for a seamless linting experience.

### Backend

Clone this repository and run the following commands below:

```bash
cd ./backend

composer install # installs Laravel dependencies
cp .env.example .env # copies .env.example file to run your own local setup
php artisan key:generate # generates your local encryption key

# By default the database is set to SQLite and the file is located under `/database/database.sqlite`.
touch database/database.sqlite # creates the SQLite database file

php artisan migrate:fresh # ensure to run all migrations

# You will need to open two terminals to serve both frontend & backend
# By default, the backend will be served at http://localhost:8000
php artisan serve
```

### Frontend

The frontend uses and runs on Nuxt 3 with Composition API, Tailwind CSS, and Fetch. To get started, run the following commands below in a separate terminal.

```bash
cd ./frontend

nvm use 16 # Nuxt 3 should be run on Node v16
pnpm install # based on your preferences, you may also use `npm` or `yarn`

# You'll need to copy the ./frontend/env.example file to point the API URL
cp .env.example .env # after running `php artisan serve`

# By default, the frontend will be served at http://localhost:3000
pnpm dev
```

## Show list of guests

Included is a command to display the list of guests:

```bash
php artisan display:guests
```

## UI / UX

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

> **Note**
> If you adjusted your backend's API URL, you need to apply the update in the frontend's .env. _By default, your .env values will work seamless with one another, without config updates._

```env
API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```
